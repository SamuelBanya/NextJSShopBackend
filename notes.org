<2023-09-13 Wed 20:26>: I ran these commands to initialize this repo from the already given backend data in the unzipped project:
#+begin_src bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
#+end_src

I then navigated to the following 'admin' page:
- http://localhost:1337/admin/auth/register-admin

I made a user with the following info:
- Username: admin_user (admin@admin.com)
- You know the rest
